A radio button, also known as an option button, provides users with the ability to select a single option from a group of choices when used in conjunction with other radio buttons. By clicking on a radio button, it becomes checked, signifying the user's selection, while all other radio buttons within the same group automatically become unchecked. The RadioButton control offers the flexibility to display text, an image, or a combination of both.
